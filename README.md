# What is [Insert future name]?

Whatever this is, inspired by /FancyName and /FamousOpenSourceName, is an open source **cloud-native "BuzzWord Here"** platform providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments.

This buzzword turns Kubernetes into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. This uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.

This cursed repository integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.


We are **NOT** a Cloud Native Computing Foundation graduated project.

## Roadmap

This repository serves as my future template for some project i'll be doing with kubernetes, with so many buzzwords i'm sure this project will be part of CNCF soon enough

## Licensing

This cursed project is under the Apache 2.0 license.
